				<p id="nc-description">I was born and raised in a small,
				country town in the heart of NC.</p><img alt="uncw" id=
				"uncw-img" src="img/uncw.jpg">

				<p id="uncw-description">I attended college at the University
				of North Carolina at Wilmington, where I graduated in 2011 with
				my BS in Public health.</p><img alt="vt" id="vt-img" src=
				"img/vt.jpg">

				<p id="vt-description">After graduation, I moved to Blacksburg,
				VA to attend Virginia Tech's Master's of Public Health program,
				concentrating in Epidemiology. However, upon visiting the
				financial aid office to apply for a Stafford loan of
				$20,000/year + a Grad Plus loan for $20,000/year, bringing my
				total to $40,000/year for a MPH....I nearly had a panic attack
				and decided to drop out and actually work in public health for
				a while before committing to that much student loan debt. BEST
				DECISION EVER!</p><img alt="atz" id="austin-img" src=
				"img/austin21.jpg">

				<p id="atx-description">Shortly, after I moved to super-fun
				Austin, TX!</p><img alt="light" id="light-img" src=
				"img/light.jpg">

				<p id="lightbulb-description">Working in public health was
				sucking the life out of me. So, I knew I had to do something
				else. Given my education background, and love for hard sciences
				(biochem, bio, human anatomy and physiology, etc.), I figured
				going to Med School was my best option. Then Phillip (my then
				boyfriend, now husband, who is a software engineer) asked me
				the question that changed my life, "Why not do software
				development like me?"</p><img alt="tth" id="tth-img" src=
				"img/team-tree-house.jpg">

				<p id="team-tree-description">I couldn't afford much, so I did
				the self-taught route. I studided my bum off for 6 months, and
				eventually landed an internship through networking and
				attending career fairs geared towards
				interns/students.</p><img alt="bug" id="bugs-img" src=
				"img/bug.jpg">

				<p id="bugs-description">I worked as in intern for the past
				year; however, the internship I was promised was not the
				reality. I worked alone, not having anyone to learn from, and
				was expected to build a full-stack Groovy and Grails
				application, which I had absolutely no experience doing. I only
				knew SQL and Java, a little Ruby, and had never actually built
				an application before. I somehow managed to get something up
				and working, but it was untested, spaghetti code. Eventually,
				the application started falling apart(bugs, bugs
				everywhere!).</p><img alt="wedding" id="wedding-img" src=
				"img/wedding.jpg">

				<p id="boulder-description">My internship brunt me out. I
				needed change in my life. So, I quit my internship, got married
				(August 2014), and moved to Boulder (November 2014)!</p>
